# Evaluation of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative
## Abstract
Environmental policies such as carbon taxes and cap-and-trade programs are pivotal in the global effort to mitigate climate change. This study seeks to evaluate the effectiveness of environmental policies with a focus on the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI). We aim to assess its impacts on CO2 emissions, energy price, economic growth, and environmental justice. This study will utilize data from emissions tracking, auction results, investment proceeds, and census data to provide a nuanced understanding of how such policies contribute to sustainable development and climate change mitigation.
